Here we will predict a customer churn based on their information. The dataset contains 13 columns:\n","\n","1. Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer\n","2. Surname: The customer's surname or last name\n","3. Credit Score: A numerical value representing the customer's credit score\n","4. Geography: The country where the customer resides (France, Spain or Germany)\n","5. Gender: The customer's gender (Male or Female)\n","6. Age: The customer's age.\n","7. Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank\n","8. Balance: The customer's account balance\n","9. NumOfProducts: The number of bank products the customer uses (e.g., savings account, credit card)\n","10. HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n","11. IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n","12. EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer\n","13. Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n","\n","The metric we will use is Area Under the ROC Curve.
